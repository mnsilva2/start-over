# Start Over 
This is my entry for the js13kgames 2019 challenge.

Start is a puzzle platformer that when the player restarts the level, they keep clones of their old tries.

This repo is a clone of the [js13k-boilerplate](https://github.com/ooflorent/js13k-boilerplate)
 by ooflorent.

Expect a lot of spaghetti code.
